/**
 * What a host supplies, `compiled-program.md` 5.2.
 *
 * An engine reads all of this from the host and none of it from anywhere else.
 * The interface is small on purpose: every fact on it is one a host already
 * has, and nothing on it is something an engine could work out and then
 * disagree with the host about.
 *
 * **The strategy's position is not here, and that is the point of the duty.**
 * An account position is held per contract and is shared with every other
 * strategy and every manual trade in it, so a strategy that read one would be
 * deciding against somebody else's trade (`stdlib.md` 17.1). What the position
 * calls read is the run's own ledger, folded from the orders this strategy sent
 * and the fills reported for them, and that ledger lives in `ledger/`.
 *
 * Every fact is optional and an absent one reads as absence in a script rather
 * than as a zero or an error. A study that sizes something by the lot size has
 * to be able to tell "one" from "nobody told me", which is the same argument
 * 2.10 makes for an absent volume.
 *
 * **There is no clock on this interface except `chart.now`.** Section 8.4 is
 * explicit: no wall clock during a bar, except `chart.now()`, whose value the
 * host supplies and the conformance suite fixes. The engine's own wall clock
 * budget is passed separately, in `LoadOptions`, because it decides when to
 * stop rather than what a script computes.
