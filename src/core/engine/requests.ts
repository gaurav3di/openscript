/**
 * Higher timeframe and other instrument reads, folded onto the chart's bars.
 *
 * A read is an expression evaluated over a **different set of bars** than the
 * chart's, whose value is then folded back onto the chart's. Two halves, and
 * they are in two files: `request-body.ts` runs the expression once per
 * requested bar, and this decides which requested bar each chart bar is allowed
 * to see. The second half is where the off-by-one lives, so it is written as
 * one comparison repeated three times rather than as three rules.
 *
 * **Bars in, buckets out.** Source bars are grouped by the bucket key of their
 * open instant (`timeframe.ts`); a bucket becomes one requested bar. The source
 * is the chart's own bars for a read of the chart's instrument, which is the
 * read `host-interface.md` 5.1 says an engine can satisfy from what it already
 * holds, and the host's answer for a read of another instrument, which it never
 * can. One fold serves both, so the two kinds of read cannot drift apart.
 *
 * **The three modes differ in one thing: how far past the chart bar the fold is
 * allowed to look.** Everything else about them is the same code.
 *
 * | Mode | Source bars it may consume | Value the chart bar takes |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `"confirmed"` | Those opening at or before this chart bar | The last bucket that closed |
 * | `"developing"` | Those opening at or before this chart bar | The bucket this bar is inside, so far |
 * | `"lookahead"` | Those belonging to this bar's bucket or earlier | The bucket this bar is inside, in full |
 *
 * Read the middle column, because it is the repainting question written out.
 * Confirmed and developing stop at the chart bar and can be computed live;
 * lookahead reads past it, which is why it repaints on history permanently and
 * by design, and why on the newest bucket, where there is nothing past the bar
 * to read, it is the bucket so far and nothing better exists.
 *
 * **The boundary.** A bucket has begun on the first chart bar whose key is the
 * new one, because a bar's open instant is what dates it. So a confirmed read
 * steps to the closed bucket's value on the first chart bar of the next bucket,
 * holds it across every bar inside that bucket including the last, and steps
 * again on the first bar of the one after. The bar a bucket closes on still
 * reads the bucket before it: at that bar's open, the bucket it is inside had
 * not closed.
 *
 * **Warmup translates by arithmetic and not by a rule.** The expression runs on
 * requested bars, so its own warmup is counted in requested bars and its absence
 * folds onto the chart like any other value: a twenty period average of daily
 * closes is absent until twenty daily bars exist, which on a five minute chart
 * is about a month in. The `warmup` field of the compiled program is what a host
 * extends the fetch range backwards by, a floor and not a promise, and an engine
 * given less gets a read that is absent for longer rather than a wrong number.
