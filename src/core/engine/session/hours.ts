/**
 * A range of wall clock hours, and where one reading sits inside it.
 *
 * Two different things in this repository are a range of hours: the
 * instrument's own trading session, which a host states in its instrument
 * record (`host-interface.md` 4.3), and the range a script writes for
 * `session.isIn` (`stdlib.md` 12.5). They are spelled differently and they mean
 * different things, but the arithmetic is one arithmetic, and it is here so
 * that it is one rule rather than two that can drift.
 *
 * **The open is inclusive and the close is exclusive**, so two ranges written
 * back to back cover every minute once and no minute twice. A range whose start
 * and end are the same minute holds nothing, which is what writing a zero length
 * range says.
 *
 * **A range whose end is before its start crosses midnight and is read that
 * way**, which is what an overnight session needs. The day list then names the
 * day the range opened on rather than the day the reading falls on, because a
 * session that opens on Friday evening and closes on Saturday morning is a
 * Friday session: reading the list against the reading's own day would drop
 * half of every overnight session and keep the wrong half.
 *
 * **A session is named by the day it opened on**, which is what tells two
 * readings in one session from two readings in two. Naming it by an instant
 * would be wrong across a seasonal clock change, where a wall clock hour inside
 * a session is not an hour of elapsed time.
