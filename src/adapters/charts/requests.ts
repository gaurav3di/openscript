/**
 * Another instrument's bars: the one thing a study needs that the chart's own
 * bars cannot answer.
 *
 * Everything else this adapter maps is computed from bars the chart already
 * holds, this included where the read is of the chart's own instrument: the
 * engine folds those itself and this is never asked. A read of **another**
 * instrument is different, and the difference is the whole of this file.
 *
 * **The engine asks once and synchronously; the chart answers later.** A
 * request's identity is fixed before bar 0 (`compiled-program.md` 2.16), so the
 * engine settles the whole set at load and asks the host for each one there and
 * then. A chart's transport is a promise. So the two are joined by a station
 * that lives in the study instance's own store: the engine's question is
 * answered from what the station holds now, which on the first pass is nothing,
 * and the answer for a read nobody has fetched yet is `pending`. The read is
 * absent, `req.isReady` is false, the rest of the study keeps drawing, and that
 * is exactly what `stdlib.md` 15.5 describes.
 *
 * **The lifecycle is what has a transport, and it runs after the first
 * calculation.** A chart computes a study once before it attaches its
 * lifecycle, so a station that waited for a transport before answering would
 * refuse the study at load rather than draw it while the bars arrive. Instead
 * the first calculation records what it was asked for, the lifecycle brings the
 * transport and fetches it, and the recompute it then asks for is the one that
 * has the bars. A study is drawn twice and never refused for a fetch that had
 * not happened yet.
 *
 * **A range is a floor, never a promise.** What the host is asked for is the
 * chart's own span, extended back by the read's `warmup` in requested bars and
 * forward to the end of the bucket the newest chart bar is inside, and then
 * quantised to bucket boundaries. Quantising is what stops a fetch per bar: the
 * range a chart asks for is then the same range for every bar inside one
 * requested bar, and it widens once when a bucket closes. A host that serves
 * less gets a read that is absent for longer, never a wrong number.
 *
 * **What was fetched keeps serving while the next fetch is in flight.** The
 * alternative is a line that breaks every time a bucket closes, which looks like
 * a defect in the study rather than a refresh in the transport. The first fetch
 * has nothing to serve and is the only one that reads as pending.
 *
 * **A failure is the host's own words.** A transport that rejects is OS6009
 * carrying the message it rejected with, which is the one the chart writes when
 * a host registered no provider at all: `req.error(read)` then says so in the
 * script, the data status says so to the user, and the study keeps drawing
 * everything that does not depend on the read.
