"""The half of a read that is settled before bar 0, and the half only a host answers.

``test_requests.py`` is the fold. This file is everything around it that no
case can reach: the load-time refusals (a case's host is a record that states
one interval), the answers a host gives other than bars (a case's host is its
files, which answer at once and never refuse), the status of a read as the two
library calls report it, the sentences those calls hand a script held to the
catalogue, the timeframe grammar at its edges, and the adapter's own host for a
case. Each test names the wrong implementation it failed against before it was
kept.
