"""One case, run on this engine, and the channels that come out of it.

This is the half of the adapter that is about the engine rather than about the
command line. It takes a case directory already read and the compiled program
the invocation was handed, loads the program, executes every bar of ``bars.csv``
and projects what it computed into the channels the case asserts, in the
encoding ``conformance.md`` section 4 gives each of them. It compares nothing.

**What this engine cannot do is named rather than guessed at, and the engine is
what names it.** ``compiled-program.md`` section 9.4 has a load refuse a program
whose capability tag the engine does not serve (OS6006), whose library entry its
manifest does not hold (OS6004), and whose format or language version it does not
implement (OS6016, OS6017). Each of those refusals carries the thing it refused,
by name, so the ``unsupported`` outcome section 9 asks for is read out of the
engine's own answer instead of being decided by a list kept here. A list kept
here would say what somebody believed this engine cannot do; the refusal says
what it actually refused.

**Every other refusal is a diagnostic and not an absence of support.** A
malformed program, a stored setting the engine will not run with, a budget
overrun, a division the script wrote: those are things this engine did, they
carry a code and a position, and they go into the ``diagnostics`` channel where a
case can assert them.

**The bars are confirmed and are not live.** A case is a run over a dataset, so
every execution is a new, confirmed, non-realtime bar with one update, and the
count supplied is the whole file: that is what makes ``bar.isLast`` true on the
last row and false everywhere else. An engine that only backtests is handed
``isRealtime`` false throughout, which is why no alert is raised here, and
``run.py`` reaches the same answer from the other side.

**A strategy case is the same loop with a desk beside it.** The frames are the
case's, delivered after the bar ``frames.csv`` names and folded before the next
execution; the orders are the calls step 9 applied, in the order the bar made
them; and the trades and the summary are folded after the last bar from the
fills, under the three facts ``backtest.json`` states. Nothing in that sentence
is this module's decision: ``ordering`` holds the boundary, ``reporting`` holds
what the report was folded under, and ``accounting`` holds the arithmetic. What
is here is the order the three are asked in.
