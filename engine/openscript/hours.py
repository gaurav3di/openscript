"""A range of wall clock hours, and where one reading sits inside it.

Two different things in this repository are a range of hours: the instrument's
own trading session, which a host states in its instrument record
(`host-interface.md` 4.3), and the range a script writes for ``session.isIn``
(`stdlib.md` 12.5). They are spelled differently and they mean different things,
and the arithmetic under them is one arithmetic, so it is here rather than in
each of them. A second copy would be a fact stated twice, and the two copies
would not drift over anything a reader could see: they would drift over midnight,
or over which day a list of days is read against, on the one dataset nobody
tests.

**The open is inclusive and the close is exclusive**, so two ranges written back
to back cover every minute once and no minute twice. A range whose start and end
are the same minute holds nothing, which is what writing a zero length range
says.

**A range whose end is before its start crosses midnight and is read that way**,
which is what an overnight session needs (4.3, and 12.5 for the script's own
spelling). The day list then names the day the range opened on rather than the
day the reading falls on, because a session that opens on Friday evening and
closes on Saturday morning is a Friday session: reading the list against the
reading's own day would drop half of every overnight session and keep the wrong
half.

**A session is named by the day it opened on**, which is what tells two readings
in one session from two readings in two. Naming it by an instant would be wrong
across a seasonal clock change, where a wall clock hour inside a session is not
an hour of elapsed time.
