"""Higher timeframe and other instrument reads, folded onto the chart's bars.

A read is an expression evaluated over a **different set of bars** than the
chart's, whose value is then folded back onto the chart's. Two halves, in two
modules: ``request_body.py`` runs the expression once per requested bar, and this
decides which requested bar each chart bar is allowed to see. The second half is
where the off-by-one lives, so it is one comparison written once rather than
three rules.

**Bars in, buckets out.** Source bars are grouped by the bucket key of their open
instant (``buckets.py``); a bucket becomes one requested bar. The source is the
chart's own bars for a read of the chart's instrument, which is the read
`host-interface.md` 5.1 says an engine satisfies from what it already holds, and
the host's answer for a read of another instrument, which it never can. One fold
serves both, so the two kinds of read cannot drift apart.

**The three modes differ in one thing: how far past the chart bar the fold may
look**, which is `compiled-program.md` 2.16.2's table. ``"confirmed"`` and
``"developing"`` consume source bars opening at or before the chart bar, and
take the last bucket that closed and the bucket this bar is inside so far;
``"lookahead"`` consumes every source bar of this bar's bucket, and takes that
bucket in full. A bucket closes when a bar of a later one is folded, never by
the clock, so a confirmed read steps on the first chart bar of the next bucket.

**A re-executed chart bar restores where each fold stood when the bar began**, and
rebuilds the bucket then forming from the source as it now stands, which is
what makes a moving bar idempotent one level down: the newest chart bar may
have been revised since the last execution, and its bucket is rebuilt from the
revision rather than from the reading it replaced. ``mark`` and ``restore`` are
that position, taken into ``run.py``'s checkpoint beside the cells. What the
position does not hold is the value of a bucket that has closed and the body's
own state: a closed bucket is closed by a bar before the newest one, which no
revision touches, and a second close of it is refused below rather than undone.
