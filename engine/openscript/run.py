"""The eleven steps of section 5.1, and the checkpoint that makes a moving bar idempotent.

Everything else in this package is a detail of one of these steps. They run in
this order, on every execution of every bar, and the order is not an
implementation's choice: steps 1 and 2 are what make a still-moving bar
idempotent, and steps 8 and 9 are what separate what a script may do on a moving
bar from what it may not.

**The checkpoint is taken before a bar rather than after one.** Section 6.1
describes it as taken at the end of bar ``i - 1``, and the state at the start of
the first execution of bar ``i`` *is* that state, so taking it there is the same
checkpoint reached by the cheaper road: nothing is copied for a bar that is
executed once, and a re-execution restores what the bar began with. Section 6.2
says outright that an engine may implement a checkpoint however it likes, and
that the specification requires the semantics rather than the representation.

**A live cell is written into the checkpoint and is not rolled back.** That is
the whole of ``live var``, and it has one consequence worth stating rather than
discovering: where a live cell and an ordinary cell held the same array, the
restore gives the ordinary cell the copy it recorded and leaves the live cell
holding what it has now, so the two stop being the same array. That follows from
the exception rather than from this implementation of it, and a script using
``live var`` is not reproducible by design.

**An error during step 6 stops the bar.** Steps 7 to 11 do not run, the bar's
columns keep whatever the previous execution published or stay absent, and the
engine reports the diagnostic. It does not carry a half executed state into the
next bar.
