 * `requests.test.ts` is the fold: which requested bar a chart bar is allowed to
 * see, over bars the engine already holds. This file is the hand-over itself.
 * Every host here is `page-host.ts`, which is `spec/host-interface.md` typed out
 * and nothing else, because a suite that drives the engine with a host written
 * against the engine tests one side of an interface twice and the other side not
 * at all. That is how a request came to carry three fields section 5.2 does not
 * print, and to carry none of three it does.
 *
 * The prices are the bar index, so a value in a column says which bar produced
 * it, which is the same convention the fold suite uses.
