/**
 * Higher timeframe and other instrument reads reaching a chart.
 *
 * The engine asks the host about every read once, synchronously, before bar 0.
 * A chart answers with a promise. Everything below is about that gap, and each
 * case is a way of closing it wrongly that still draws something:
 *
 * - A study refused at load because the fetch had not happened yet is a study a
 *   chart never adds. The lifecycle that has the transport runs after the first
 *   calculation, so the first calculation has to be able to say "not yet".
 * - A read of the chart's own instrument at a coarser interval needs no host at
 *   all, and a study that waited for one would wait for ever.
 * - A refusal turned into an empty answer looks exactly like an instrument that
 *   did not trade.
 * - A range recomputed per bar is a fetch per bar, which is invisible on a test
 *   that loads a chart once and expensive on a chart that ticks.
